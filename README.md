## 🏡 Best Counties to Live in the U.S.

This project explores the question: **Where in the U.S. should different types of households consider living, based on their specific needs and constraints?**

The analysis is tailored for four demographic groups—**young families**, **first-generation immigrants**, **recent graduates**, and **empty nesters**—who often face distinct lifestyle trade-offs. Using over **50 county-level indicators**, the project evaluates U.S. counties on **affordability, healthcare access, education, safety, diversity**, and more.

Seven datasets from trusted federal sources (e.g., **U.S. Census**, **HUD**, **County Health Rankings**) were cleaned, merged, and standardized using **FIPS codes** to enable localized, multi-dimensional comparisons. Metrics span from **2019–2024** and cover economic, demographic, health, and environmental dimensions.
